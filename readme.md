# Official mMass Repository

This is the official source code backup repository for
[mMass](http://www.mmass.org) software. Although mMass is no longer actively
developed and supported I decided to put the code here for others to be able
to share it, fork it and all the git craziness. Feel free to make your own
changes but please do not expect further contributions from my side.

At the time of writing the mMass code I was really not a programmer.
Programming was just a hobby and I was doing it rather for fun. Please respect
this while reading and modifying the original code :)

For more information and latest distributions please see the official mMass
homepage at [www.mmass.org](http://www.mmass.org).

Thank you for your interest, and ... have fun!


## Requirements

The mMass code was developed under Python 2 and has never been updated to
Python 3. Same is true for all the dependencies such as wxPython and NumPy.
The code was last tested against the following versions of said libraries
and **it is known to not work properly with current versions**. At the end
of the day, the code has not been touched since 2013.

- Python 2.7
- NumPy 1.5
- wxPython 2.8.12.1
